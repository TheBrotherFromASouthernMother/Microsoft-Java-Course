#Java Programming via Microsoft

<p> Just a simple repo to keep track of everything I am learning while taking Microsoft's Entry Level Software Development course on Edx </p>
<p> Class notes will be stored in the "notes" directory, class assignments will be stored in the "assignments" directory, and <br>
 the random little programs I write out of simple curioisty will be left to clutter the root directory. </p>
